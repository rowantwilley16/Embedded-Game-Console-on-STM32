# MicrocontrollerGameConsole
 - This project is a retro game console made by hand using a STM nucleo F103RB microcontroller. 
 - The console is programmed with 2 games : the classic maze game (with 4 different levels) and the classic pong game. 
 - The project implements a 8x8 LED grid matrix to act as a low resolution game screen.
 - Inputs include mechanical switch buttons(active low), analog sliders(DAC interface) and a MEMS accelerometer(i2C interface) for orientation detection. 
 - The included project report shows the setup of the system with circuit schematics and design choices and implemetations. 
 - The report should outline the project from start to finish and should be easy to follow for someone who wishes to copy the project.
